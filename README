Introduction
------------

wmlj is a WindowMaker dock-app that sits in the corner of your screen
and monitors your Friends List at livejournal.com. Now that LJ
addiction spreads its slimy tentacles all over the world, such a
program becomes absolutely essential for every Unix desktop.


Requirements
------------
wmlj requires GTK+ 1.2 or greater
(http://www.gtk.org/)

wmlj also requires libcurl, an multiprotocol transfer library
(http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)


Getting Started
---------------
In order to use wmlj, you need a valid LiveJournal account, which you
can create at http://livejournal.com/

The installation os fairly obvious.
Running:
	$ ./configure 
	$ make
	$ su
	# make install
should be all you need to install it.

The installed executable is called "wmlj".

Using wmlj
------------
Refer to the man page - wmlj(1).

Known Bugs
----------
Too much.

Thanks

Brad Fitzpatrick <bradfitz@livejournal.com> - for making LiveJournal!

Evan Martin <evan@livejournal.com> - for writing LogJam
(http://logjam.danga.com), a great GTK+ LJ client, which provided me
with insipration and also gave me some insights into the inner
workings of GTK+. Some wmlj code is based on LogJam.

Alexey Vyskubov <alexey@pepper.spb.ru> - for writing foodock library
(http://freshmeat.net/projects/foodock/), which spared me the hassle
of figuring out how to write a dockapp.
